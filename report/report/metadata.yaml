# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "Multimodal sarcasm detection is an important
research topic in natural language processing
and multimedia computing, and benefits
a wide range of applications in multiple domains.
Most existing studies regard the incongruity
between image and text as the indicative
clue in identifying multimodal sarcasm.
To capture cross-modal incongruity,
previous methods rely on fixed architectures
in network design, which restricts the model
from dynamically adjusting to diverse imagetext
pairs. Inspired by routing-based dynamic
network, we model the dynamic mechanism
in multimodal sarcasm detection and propose
the Dynamic Routing Transformer Network
(DynRT-Net). Our method utilizes dynamic
paths to activate different routing transformer
modules with hierarchical co-attention adapting
to cross-modal incongruity. Experimental
results on a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method compared to the stateof-
the-art methods. Our codes are available at
https://github.com/TIAN-viola/DynRT."
